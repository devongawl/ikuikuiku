# Grid-Based Movement Implementation Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Grid Movement System
- Created `GridMovementController.ts` that handles discrete grid-based movement
- Each key press moves the character exactly one grid unit (2 world units)
- Movement is queued and animated smoothly over 0.25 seconds
- Character hops slightly during movement for visual appeal

### 2. Key Features Implemented
- **Movement Queue**: Up to 3 moves can be queued
- **Smooth Animation**: Character interpolates between grid positions
- **Rotation**: Character faces the direction of movement
- **Debug Panel**: Shows current grid position, queue length, and movement state

### 3. Controls
- **W / ↑**: Move forward (negative Z)
- **S / ↓**: Move backward (positive Z)  
- **A / ←**: Move left (negative X)
- **D / →**: Move right (positive X)
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out

### 4. Technical Details
- Grid size: 2 world units per grid square
- Move duration: 0.25 seconds
- Hop height: 0.3 units
- Camera smoothly follows character position

## How It Works
1. Key press adds a move to the queue
2. If not currently moving, start processing the next move
3. Character animates from current position to target position
4. On completion, process next move in queue

## Benefits Over Continuous Movement
- More precise control
- Easier to implement puzzle mechanics
- Clear, predictable movement
- Better for memory/interaction placement
- Classic game feel

## Next Steps
- Add collision detection with buildings/objects
- Implement boundary checking
- Add sound effects for footsteps
- Consider adding diagonal movement
- Align interactive memories to grid positions
