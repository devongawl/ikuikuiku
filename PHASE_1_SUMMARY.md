# Phase 1 Implementation Summary - Apartment Scene

## What Was Implemented

### Apartment Layout
Created a cozy apartment with 4 distinct areas:
1. **Bedroom** (starting position at -6, 0)
   - Bed with frame, mattress, and pillow
   - Nightstand with design sketches
   - Calendar on the wall
   
2. **Bathroom** (-6, -8)
   - Simple door representation
   
3. **Kitchen** (0, -8)
   - Counter with coffee maker
   - Pink coffee mug
   - Kitchen table with chairs
   
4. **Living Room** (6, 0)
   - Blue couch with coffee table
   - Red rug
   - Exit door to leave apartment

### Interactive Memories
Three key memories that establish the "ordinary Tuesday" narrative:
1. **Coffee Mug**: "Just another Tuesday morning... I needed my usual coffee to start the day."
2. **Design Sketches**: "The new app redesign was coming along. I was excited to show the team my latest ideas."
3. **Calendar**: "September 15th. Nothing special planned. Just another day at the office... or so I thought."

### Visual Atmosphere
- Warm morning lighting with directional sun
- Beige/warm color palette for floors and walls
- Decorative plants throughout
- Shadows and ambient lighting for depth

### Scene Transition
- Exit door in living room triggers transition to next scene
- 2-second delay after clicking door before scene change
- Sets up for "office-building" scene (to be implemented)

## How to Play
1. Start in the bedroom
2. Use WASD or arrow keys to move (grid-based)
3. Click on glowing objects to discover memories
4. Explore the apartment and discover all three memories
5. Click the exit door to proceed to the office

## Technical Details
- Scene extends base Scene class
- Uses simple geometry for furniture (no external assets yet)
- Memories stored in object userData for transition handling
- Warm color scheme throughout (morning atmosphere)

## Next Steps
- Phase 2: Create office building scene with elevator
- Add transition effects between scenes
- Consider adding more visual details with Kenney assets
- Add ambient sounds (coffee brewing, morning birds, etc.)
